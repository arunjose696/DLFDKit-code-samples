# Intel oneAPI DL Framework Developer Toolkit (DLFD Kit)
change
The Intel oneAPI DL Framework Developer Toolkit is a suite of development libraries that make it fast and easy to build or optimize a deep learning framework that gets every last ounce of performance out of the newest Intel processors. This toolkit enables  Deep Learning Framework with flexible options including optimial peformance on CPU, GPU, FPGA or a Domain Optimized Accelerator. 

Included in this toolkit are:

·        Intel oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)

·        Intel oneAPI Collective Communications Library (oneCCL)
